**Project Title:**
"Optimizing EEG Channel Selection for Enhanced Person Identification using Binary Grey Wolf Algorithm"

**Project Description:**
This project introduces an innovative approach to improving person identification accuracy by leveraging the Binary Grey Wolf Optimization (BGWO) algorithm for EEG channel selection. By intelligently choosing optimal channels in an Electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset, the project aims to enhance the precision of person identification. The process involves loading an artificial EEG dataset from a CSV file and formulating a comprehensive objective function that amalgamates crucial performance metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, recall, and specificity. The BGWO algorithm is then employed to minimize the negative combination of these metrics, ensuring the selection of the most informative EEG channels. To further enhance accuracy, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel is utilized for person identification. The project's primary goal is to efficiently identify relevant EEG channels, ultimately achieving superior classification performance.
