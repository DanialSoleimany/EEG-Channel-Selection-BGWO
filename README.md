1. **Project Title**
Enhancing Person Identification via EEG Channel Selection Utilizing Binary Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm

2. **Project Description**
The project is an implementation of a Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer (BGWO) for the selection of optimal channels in an Electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset used for person identification. The artificial EEG dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and the objective function combines multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, recall, and specificity. The BGWO algorithm optimizes the selection of EEG channels by minimizing the negative combination of these metrics. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel is employed for person identification. The project aims to efficiently identify the most relevant EEG channels while achieving high classification performance.
